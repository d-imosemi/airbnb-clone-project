# airbnb-clone-project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

Learning Objective
This project is tailored to enhance your expertise in modern software development practices. By completing these tasks, learners will:

Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
Implement advanced security measures for API development.
Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.


Team Roles

Business Analyst (BA)
  Bridges the client's business processes and technical implementation—translating stakeholder needs and domain logic into clear requirements for the development team.

Product Owner (PO)
  Owns the product vision—aligns the product with business goals and market demands, manages the product backlog, and ensures the final deliverables meet the customer's expectations.

Project Manager (PM)
  Oversees timelines and budgets, coordinates tasks, and ensures the team delivers effectively—especially in Agile environments, they promote transparency, continuous improvement, and alignment between business priorities and execution.

UI/UX Designer
  Crafts intuitive user interfaces and flows. The UI designer focuses on visuals and interaction design, while the UX designer researches and structures the overall user journey—from personas to prototypes.

Software Architect
  Defines the system’s high-level structure, technology stack, and design standards. Ensures that the architecture is scalable, maintainable, secure, and aligned with project goals.

Software Developer
  Builds the application. This includes both front-end and back-end developers who write, debug, test, and deliver code to bring features to lilife.
  
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer & Test Automation Engineer
  QA Engineers validate functionality through manual and automated tests, ensuring software quality and stability. Automation engineers build test frameworks and scripts to streamline regression testing and speed up feedback.

DevOps Engineer
  Bridges development and operations—designing and managing CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, deployment strategies, and ensuring smooth delivery and scalability.

Backend Developer
  Designs and implements server-side logic, APIs, and integrations. Responsible for data modeling, business logic, system performance, and secure communication between front-end and databases. They’re more than coders—they architect efficient, reliable solutions under the hood.

Database Administrator (DBA)
  (While not specifically mentioned by ITRex) A DBA manages database systems—handles schema design, performance tuning, backup & recovery, and enforces data integrity and security across environments.


Technology Stack


Django
  A Python-based web framework that simplifies backend development. In this project, Django is used to build the server-side logic and expose RESTful APIs for features like user authentication, property listings, reservations, and payment flows.

Django REST Framework (DRF)
  An extension for Django that makes it easier to build and manage REST APIs. It helps handle serialization, authentication, and API endpoints efficiently.

GraphQL
  An alternative to REST for data querying. In the project, GraphQL enables the frontend to request only the data it needs (e.g., listing details, user profile, or booking availability) in a single query, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

PostgreSQL
  A relational database used to store structured data like user accounts, property listings, booking records, payments, and reviews. It supports complex queries, indexing, and ACID compliance—critical for a transactional system like Airbnb.

Docker
  Used to containerize the application and its services (backend, database, etc.). This ensures the project runs consistently across different environments (development, staging, production).

Redis
  Used for caching (e.g., storing session data, query results, or availability checks) and for managing background tasks like sending emails or notifications.

Celery
  A task queue that works with Redis or RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing (e.g., sending confirmation emails, processing payments, cleaning expired reservations).


  Database Design

 1.User

Represents hosts and guests.
Important Fields

* 'id' – unique identifier
* `name` – full name of the user
* `email` – login credential (unique)
* `role` – "host" or "guest" (a user can be both)
* `created_at` – account creation date

Relationships

* A User can list multiple Properties.
* A User can make multiple Bookings.
* A User can leave Reviews for Properties or other Users (hosts).



2. Property

Represents a listing (house, apartment, room, etc.).
Important Fields

* `id` – unique identifier
* `title` – property name/short description
* `description` – detailed information about the property
* `location` – address or geo-coordinates
* `price_per_night` – base cost for booking

Relationships

* A Property belongs to one User (host).
* A Property can have multiple Bookings.
* A Property can have multiple Reviews.


 3. Booking

Represents a reservation made by a guest.
Important Fields

* `id` – unique identifier
* `check_in` – start date of stay
* `check_out` – end date of stay
* `status` – pending, confirmed, canceled, completed
* `total_price` – calculated cost for the booking

Relationships

* A Booking belongs to one Property.
* A Booking is made by one User (guest).
* A Booking may have one Payment associated.



 4. Review

Represents feedback left by a guest (and possibly host reviews of guests).
Important Fields

* `id` – unique identifier
* `rating` – numerical score (e.g., 1–5)
* `comment` – review text

* `reviewer_id` – who left the review

Relationships

* A Review belongs to a User (reviewer).
* A Review belongs to a Property (and optionally to a host/guest directly).



5. Payment

Represents transactions for bookings.
Important Fields

* `id` – unique identifier
* `amount` – total paid
