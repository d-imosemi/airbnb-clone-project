Team Roles

Business Analyst (BA)
  Bridges the client's business processes and technical implementation—translating stakeholder needs and domain logic into clear requirements for the development team.

Product Owner (PO)
  Owns the product vision—aligns the product with business goals and market demands, manages the product backlog, and ensures the final deliverables meet the customer's expectations.

Project Manager (PM)
  Oversees timelines and budgets, coordinates tasks, and ensures the team delivers effectively—especially in Agile environments, they promote transparency, continuous improvement, and alignment between business priorities and execution.

UI/UX Designer
  Crafts intuitive user interfaces and flows. The UI designer focuses on visuals and interaction design, while the UX designer researches and structures the overall user journey—from personas to prototypes.

Software Architect
  Defines the system’s high-level structure, technology stack, and design standards. Ensures that the architecture is scalable, maintainable, secure, and aligned with project goals.

Software Developer
  Builds the application. This includes both front-end and back-end developers who write, debug, test, and deliver code to bring features to lilife.
  
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer & Test Automation Engineer
  QA Engineers validate functionality through manual and automated tests, ensuring software quality and stability. Automation engineers build test frameworks and scripts to streamline regression testing and speed up feedback.

DevOps Engineer
  Bridges development and operations—designing and managing CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure automation, deployment strategies, and ensuring smooth delivery and scalability.

Backend Developer
  Designs and implements server-side logic, APIs, and integrations. Responsible for data modeling, business logic, system performance, and secure communication between front-end and databases. They’re more than coders—they architect efficient, reliable solutions under the hood.

Database Administrator (DBA)
  (While not specifically mentioned by ITRex) A DBA manages database systems—handles schema design, performance tuning, backup & recovery, and enforces data integrity and security across environments.


Technology Stack


Django
  A Python-based web framework that simplifies backend development. In this project, Django is used to build the server-side logic and expose RESTful APIs for features like user authentication, property listings, reservations, and payment flows.

Django REST Framework (DRF)
  An extension for Django that makes it easier to build and manage REST APIs. It helps handle serialization, authentication, and API endpoints efficiently.

GraphQL
  An alternative to REST for data querying. In the project, GraphQL enables the frontend to request only the data it needs (e.g., listing details, user profile, or booking availability) in a single query, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

PostgreSQL
  A relational database used to store structured data like user accounts, property listings, booking records, payments, and reviews. It supports complex queries, indexing, and ACID compliance—critical for a transactional system like Airbnb.

Docker
  Used to containerize the application and its services (backend, database, etc.). This ensures the project runs consistently across different environments (development, staging, production).

Redis
  Used for caching (e.g., storing session data, query results, or availability checks) and for managing background tasks like sending emails or notifications.

Celery
  A task queue that works with Redis or RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing (e.g., sending confirmation emails, processing payments, cleaning expired reservations).

Feature Breakdown


 1. User Management

Handles authentication, authorization, and profile management. Users can sign up as guests or hosts, log in securely, and manage their personal details. This ensures a trusted environment where both hosts and guests can interact safely.



2. Property Management

Hosts can create, update, and manage their property listings with details like title, description, location, pricing, and availability. This feature allows the platform to showcase diverse accommodations, forming the core offering of the booking service.



3. Booking System

Guests can search for properties, select dates, and make reservations. The system ensures availability checks, manages booking statuses (pending, confirmed, canceled), and prevents double-bookings. This feature drives the main functionality of connecting guests with hosts.



 4. Review & Rating System

Guests can leave feedback and ratings for properties they’ve stayed in, and optionally, hosts can review guests. This fosters transparency, builds trust, and encourages quality service across the platform.



 5. Payment Processing

Handles secure online transactions for bookings. Integrates with payment gateways (e.g., credit card, PayPal) to process payments, track statuses, and manage refunds if necessary. This feature ensures the business side of the platform functions smoothly.



6. Search & Filtering

Enables users to find properties by location, price range, dates, and amenities. This makes the platform more user-friendly by allowing guests to quickly find accommodations that match their preferences.



7. Security & Authentication

Implements features like encrypted passwords, session management, and possibly two-factor authentication. This safeguards sensitive user information and ensures secure interactions between guests and hosts.




API Security


 1. Authentication

* What it is: Secure login and identity verification (e.g., email/password with hashing, JWT tokens, or OAuth for third-party logins).
* Why it’s crucial: Ensures only verified users (hosts/guests) can access their accounts, protecting personal data and preventing unauthorized access.


2. Authorization

* What it is: Role-based access control (RBAC) to define what actions users can perform (e.g., only hosts can manage properties, only guests can make bookings).
* Why it’s crucial: Prevents misuse of the system by ensuring users can only perform actions relevant to their role, securing sensitive operations.



3. Data Encryption

* What it is: Encrypting sensitive data at rest (e.g., hashed passwords, encrypted payment tokens) and in transit (via HTTPS/TLS).
* Why it’s crucial: Protects user credentials, personal info, and financial data from breaches and man-in-the-middle attacks.



4. Secure Payments

* What it is: Integration with trusted payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) that handle PCI compliance, tokenization, and fraud detection.
* Why it’s crucial: Prevents financial fraud, protects card details, and ensures trust in handling guest payments and host payouts.



5. Rate Limiting & Throttling

* What it is: Limiting the number of API requests a user/IP can make in a given timeframe.
* Why it’s crucial: Protects against brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.



6. Input Validation & Sanitization

* What it is: Validating and cleaning all user input to prevent SQL injection, XSS (cross-site scripting), and CSRF (cross-site request forgery).
* Why it’s crucial: Ensures that malicious users cannot inject harmful code or compromise the database and frontend.



7. Logging & Monitoring

* What it is: Keeping detailed logs of user activities, failed login attempts, and unusual behavior.
* Why it’s crucial: Helps detect suspicious activity early (e.g., account takeovers, fraud attempts) and supports audits for compliance.



 8. Secure Session Management

* What it is: Using secure cookies, session expiration, and logout mechanisms.
* Why it’s crucial: Prevents session hijacking, keeping users safely logged in without exposing tokens.
